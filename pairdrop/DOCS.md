## Reverse Proxy Configuration

To add a reverse proxy to Pairdrop, you will reverse proxy to the internal hostname of the container.

Using `nginx-proxy-manager` and this repository, you would reverse proxy to `wrouesnel-pairdrop:3000`.
Make sure to enable Websocket Support.

## TURN Server Configuration

In complicated network environments you may need to install or specify a TURN server in order to get reliable
communications between peers using WebRTC. The `rtc_config` object should be updated with TURN server details
if you do this.
